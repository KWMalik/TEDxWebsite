<p>For over thirty years, Herbert Chase, MD, MA, has been teaching clinical medicine and basic science to medical students, interns and residents, and junior and senior faculty at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is a board certified Internist and Nephrologist who spent the early part of his career as a basic scientist. After shifting his interest from research to education, he directed and participated in several major medical school courses. In 2000 he left Columbia University and was appointed the first Deputy Dean for Education at Yale School of Medicine where he introduced several major programmatic changes. In 2006 he returned to Columbia to enter the Masters program in Biomedical Informatics as an NLM-funded Post Doctoral Fellow. Dr. Chase has been recognized for his outstanding teaching with many awards including the Presidential Teaching Award of Columbia University.</p>
